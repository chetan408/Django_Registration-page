## User_Registration_Page

This project includes a user registration page built with Django using PyCharm. The process involves:

1. **Project Setup**: Created a Django project and app to manage user registration.
2. **Registration Form**: Utilized Django's `UserCreationForm` to design the registration form.
3. **Views**: Implemented a view to handle form submissions and user creation.
4. **URL Configuration**: Added URL patterns to link the registration page.
5. **Templates**: Designed an HTML template for the registration page with form integration.
6. **Authentication**: Configured Djangoâ€™s authentication system for seamless user management.

The registration page allows new users to create an account and is fully functional with proper validation and user-friendly design.
